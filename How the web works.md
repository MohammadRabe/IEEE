## How does the web works ?
When the user writes in the browser a **URL** of any website
the **URL** is sent to the **DNS** server and mapping to the IP address of the website is happening
then a HTTP request is sent to the server so it sends back the HTTP response to the browser

- There is an encrypted version of HTTP and it is **HTTPS**

- In the case of browser the response is a HTML file
- In the case of mobo application the response is application/json file
